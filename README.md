**Paper**: Multi-task deep learning-based failure diagnosis for tubular joints: Automated identification and description generation<br />

**Abstract**: <br />Tubular joints are critical yet vulnerable components in offshore platforms and bridges, where complex stress states frequently lead to concurrent failure modes such as weld cracking, brace buckling, and chord plastification. Traditional failure inspection is labor-intensive and time-consuming, while emerging intelligent methods generally rely on single-task or single-modal designs that can only provide coarse failure labels or isolated descriptive information. These methods often struggle to fully exploit the richness of multi-modal data and effectively capture coexisting failure patterns, resulting in limited interpretability and incomplete diagnostics. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a multi-task deep learning model for failure identification and description generation of tubular joints. A multi-modal database is compiled from 122 experimental programs, including 350 failed joints with images, textual descriptions, and component-level labels, which is further augmented to 1,050 images and 3,150 sentences. The devised model employs a pretrained encoder for image features extraction, a multi-label classification decoder for failure identification, and an attention-based image captioning decoder for failure description generation. A consistency loss enforces semantic alignment between label and textual outputs. The developed model achieves a BLEU-4 of 76.30 and an mAP of 0.9444, outperforming single-task baselines. Validation on real engineering images demonstrates excellent generalization, highlighting its potential for automated failure diagnosis.<br />
